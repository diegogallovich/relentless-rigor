Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for any website's success. As developers, understanding SEO fundamentals helps us build sites that both users and search engines love.

## Technical SEO Basics

### Meta Tags Matter

Always include proper meta tags in your HTML:

```html
<meta name="description" content="A compelling description that encourages clicks" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Page Title" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description for social sharing" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
```

### Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements to help search engines understand your content structure:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Main Article Title</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>Section Heading</h2>
    <p>Content goes here...</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

## Performance and Core Web Vitals

Google considers page speed as a ranking factor. Focus on:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Optimize images and server response times
2. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Minimize JavaScript execution time
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Prevent unexpected layout shifts

## Mobile-First Indexing

Google predominantly uses mobile versions of content for indexing and ranking. Ensure:

- Your site is fully responsive
- Mobile and desktop content parity
- Fast loading times on mobile networks
- Touch-friendly navigation

## Structured Data

Help search engines understand your content with structured data:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Your Article Title",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Diego Gallovich"
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-03-10"
}
```
