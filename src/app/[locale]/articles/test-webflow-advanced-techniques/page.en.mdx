Webflow has revolutionized how we build websites, combining visual design with professional code output. Here are some advanced techniques to take your Webflow projects to the next level.

## Custom Code Integration

While Webflow's visual builder is powerful, sometimes you need custom code. Here's how to integrate it seamlessly.

### Embed Custom Scripts

Use Webflow's embed element to add custom JavaScript functionality:

```html
<script>
  // Custom analytics or third-party integrations
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    // Your custom code here
  })
</script>
```

## CMS Collections Best Practices

Webflow's CMS is incredibly flexible. Structure your collections wisely:

1. **Plan your content model** before building
2. **Use reference fields** to create relationships between collections
3. **Leverage multi-reference fields** for tagging and categorization
4. **Keep your collection names clear** and consistent

## Performance Optimization

Fast websites are essential. Here are key optimization strategies:

- Optimize images before uploading to Webflow
- Use Webflow's responsive image features
- Minimize custom code where possible
- Leverage Webflow's built-in CDN

## Responsive Design Tips

Make your Webflow sites look great on all devices:

- Start with mobile design first
- Use Flexbox and Grid for layouts
- Test on actual devices, not just the designer
- Pay attention to touch targets on mobile
